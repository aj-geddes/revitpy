apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: revitpy-api
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Scale based on demand
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: revitpy-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: revitpy-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: revitpy-api
        image: revitpy/api:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
        env:
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: revitpy-secrets
              key: database-url
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: revitpy-api-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: revitpy-api
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

#### Vertical Scaling
```yaml
# Resource optimization for large deployments
resources:
  api_servers:
    cpu: "2000m"
    memory: "4Gi"
    replicas: 5
  
  database:
    cpu: "4000m" 
    memory: "16Gi"
    storage: "1Ti"
  
  cache:
    cpu: "1000m"
    memory: "8Gi"
    replicas: 3
```

policies:
  package_management:
    require_signing: true
    vulnerability_threshold: "medium"
    auto_update: false
    approval_required: true
  
  access_control:
    mfa_required: true
    session_timeout: 28800  # 8 hours
    ip_whitelist_enabled: true
