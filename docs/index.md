### Component Overview

| Component | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Core API** | Primary developer interface | Element access, transactions, utilities |
| **ORM Layer** | Object-relational mapping | LINQ-style queries, relationships, caching |
| **Extension System** | Plugin architecture | Dependency injection, lifecycle management |
| **Async Support** | Asynchronous operations | Progress tracking, cancellation, task queues |
| **.NET Bridge** | Python-Revit interop | Type conversion, memory management, error handling |
| **Package Manager** | Distribution system | Secure packages, dependency resolution |
| **VS Code Extension** | Development environment | IntelliSense, debugging, project management |

## Code Examples

### Basic Element Query
```python title="query_walls.py"
from revitpy import RevitContext

# Query walls with modern ORM syntax
with RevitContext() as context:
    walls = context.elements.where(
        lambda e: e.Category == 'Walls' and e.Height > 10.0
    )
    
    for wall in walls:
        print(f"Wall: {wall.Name}, Height: {wall.Height}")
```

### Advanced Filtering with Relationships
```python title="advanced_filtering.py"
from revitpy import RevitContext

with RevitContext() as context:
    # Find rooms with specific area requirements
    large_rooms = (context.elements
                   .of_category('Rooms')
                   .where(lambda r: r.Area > 500)
                   .include('Boundaries.Wall')  # Load related walls
                   .to_list())
    
    for room in large_rooms:
        wall_count = len(room.Boundaries)
        print(f"Room {room.Name}: {room.Area} sq ft, {wall_count} walls")
```

### Async Operations
```python title="async_processing.py"
import asyncio
from revitpy import AsyncRevitContext

async def process_elements():
    async with AsyncRevitContext() as context:
        # Process large datasets asynchronously
        elements = await context.elements.where(
            lambda e: e.Category == 'Windows'
        ).to_list_async()
        
        tasks = [update_element(elem) for elem in elements]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        
        return results

async def update_element(element):
    # Simulate async processing
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return f"Processed {element.Name}"
```
