## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Complementary Workflow

RevitPy **complements** PyRevit rather than replacing it:

```
PyRevit ‚Üí Extract Data ‚Üí RevitPy ‚Üí Advanced Processing ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Import Results ‚Üí PyRevit ‚Üí Update Model ‚Üí Revit
```

### 2. Integration Pattern

Each POC follows this integration pattern:

1. **PyRevit Data Export**: Extract Revit data with PyRevit scripts
2. **RevitPy Processing**: Advanced analysis with modern Python libraries  
3. **Result Generation**: Create comprehensive analysis results
4. **PyRevit Import**: Import results back to update Revit model

### 3. Development Approach

- **Modular Design**: Each POC is self-contained with clear interfaces
