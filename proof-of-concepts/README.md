# RevitPy Proof-of-Concept Applications

## Overview

This directory contains 5 compelling proof-of-concept applications that demonstrate RevitPy's unique value proposition - capabilities that are **impossible** with PyRevit/IronPython and provide clear ROI for data science and ML use cases in AEC.

## Proof-of-Concepts

### 1. Building Energy Performance Analytics Dashboard
**Directory:** `energy-analytics/`
**Problem:** PyRevit cannot perform advanced statistical analysis or create interactive visualizations
**Solution:** Modern data science stack (NumPy, Pandas, Plotly) for comprehensive energy analysis
**ROI:** Replace $50K+ external energy modeling software with Python-based solution

### 2. ML-Powered Space Planning Optimization
**Directory:** `ml-space-planning/`
**Problem:** PyRevit cannot run machine learning algorithms for design optimization
**Solution:** TensorFlow/scikit-learn for intelligent space planning
**ROI:** 30-50% improvement in space efficiency vs manual planning

### 3. Real-time IoT Sensor Integration with Cloud APIs
**Directory:** `iot-sensor-integration/`
**Problem:** PyRevit cannot handle async operations or modern cloud API integration
**Solution:** Async/await with cloud SDKs for real-time building monitoring
**ROI:** Enable $100K+ facility management automation and predictive maintenance

### 4. Advanced Structural Analysis with Modern Libraries
**Directory:** `structural-analysis/`
**Problem:** PyRevit cannot perform complex numerical computations or structural analysis
**Solution:** SciPy, NumPy for advanced engineering calculations
**ROI:** Replace $25K+ structural analysis software licenses

### 5. Construction Progress Monitoring with Computer Vision
**Directory:** `computer-vision-progress/`
**Problem:** PyRevit cannot process images or run computer vision algorithms
**Solution:** OpenCV, TensorFlow for automated progress tracking
**ROI:** 60-80% reduction in manual progress reporting time

## Common Infrastructure

The `common/` directory contains shared utilities, mock data generators, and base classes used across all POCs.

## Running the POCs

Each POC directory contains:
- `src/` - Source code and main application
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `data/` - Sample datasets and test data
- `docs/` - Detailed documentation and ROI analysis
- `examples/` - Usage examples and tutorials

## Requirements

All POCs require RevitPy with access to the modern Python ecosystem:
- NumPy, Pandas, SciPy for numerical computing
- TensorFlow, scikit-learn for machine learning
- OpenCV for computer vision
- asyncio, aiohttp for async operations
- Plotly, Matplotlib for visualizations
- Azure/AWS SDKs for cloud integration

## Key Differentiators from PyRevit

1. **Modern Python Libraries** - Access to the full scientific Python ecosystem
2. **Async/Await Support** - Real-time data processing and cloud integration
3. **Machine Learning** - Advanced algorithms for optimization and prediction
4. **Computer Vision** - Image processing and automated analysis
5. **High-Performance Computing** - Complex numerical computations
6. **Cloud Integration** - Modern API clients and IoT platforms

Each POC demonstrates capabilities that are fundamentally impossible with PyRevit's IronPython 2.7 limitations.
